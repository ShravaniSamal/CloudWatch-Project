# CloudWatch-Project
This project enables real-time CPU monitoring on an AWS EC2 instance using CloudWatch and SNS alerts. A Python script spikes CPU usage, triggering a CloudWatch Alarm that sends an email notification via SNS when utilization exceeds the threshold. This helps in automated monitoring, proactive alerting, and better system reliability
